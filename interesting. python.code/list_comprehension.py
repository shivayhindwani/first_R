# EXPRESSION =  is the expression to evaluate and include in the new list.
# ITEM= is the variable representing each item in the iterable.
# ITERABLE =  is the existing iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string, range) that you want to iterate over.
# CONDITION =  (optional) is a conditional statement that filters the items. 
# Only items for which the condition evaluates to True will be included in the new list.

# print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
