// The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of algorithms, data structures,
// and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs.
// The STL provides a range of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps,
// as well as algorithms for searching, sorting and manipulating data.
