// stl array 
// include header file <array>
// The array is a collection of homogeneous objects and this array container is defined for constant size arrays or (static size).
// This container wraps around fixed-size arrays and 
// the information of its size are not lost when declared to a pointer. 

// operation that we can perform 
// go gfg to check 



// stl vector  done before , check the folder vector .
// Point to NOte = we can copy one vector to another 

// stl deque or double ended queue .
// in deque we can insert from both the end and can delete from both the end .
// done befor check folder deque

// Note = In some container like list or deque erase function  will not work directly 
// we need to specify the position of the indexes using begin and end iterator or 
// begin + position where to delete the elements .
//  and in some container such as vector to delete elements we can use
// clear function that does not require any arguments .

// stl list
//  done before check folder list

// stl stack
// last in first out concept is followed .
// done before check folder stack.

// stl queue
// first in first out concept is followed.
// done before check folder queue .

// stl priority queue.
// by default priority queue is in max heap means elements are displayed in descending order .
// can make a min heap using a syntax .
// done before check folder priority queue .

// stl set
// no  duplicate values are allowed . Only unique elements will be showed.
// set display value in sorted order that is in ascending order .
// can use function such as FIND and COUNT 
// for more detail check folder set or go to gfg website .

// stl map 
// check folder map.


// check all build in algorithm in stl .
// and write their theory here .
