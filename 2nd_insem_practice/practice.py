# PACKAGES = provide a way to organize your code into logical units,
# making it easier to manage and maintain, especially in larger projects.
# They help you avoid naming conflicts, improve code readability, and facilitate code reuse.

# LAMBDA= A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.
# Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but they can only have one expression. 

# example code

# add = lambda x, y: x + y
# result=add(4,5)
# print(result)

# STRING= 
# In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (''), double quotes ("") or triple quotes (''' or """).
# Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created

# so many built in functions using string in python are available  , use chat gpt.

# GLOBAL STATEMENT =In Python,
# the global statement is used inside a function to indicate that a variable defined within the function should be treated as a global variable,
# rather than a local variable


# FUNCTIONS ARGUMENTS = 4 types        ,  use chat gpt for syntax
# 1.Required argument
# 2.Default     "
# 3.Keyword     "
# 4.Varaible lenght argument

# FUNCTION RETURNING MORE THAN ONE VALUE=
#  In Python, you can return more than one value from a function by simply returning a tuple of values. Here's an example:

# def calculate_stats(numbers):
#     total = sum(numbers)
#     average = total / len(numbers)
#     maximum = max(numbers)
#     minimum = min(numbers)
#     return total, average, maximum, minimum

# numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# total, average, maximum, minimum = calculate_stats(numbers)
# print("Total:", total)
# print("Average:", average)
# print("Maximum:", maximum)
# print("Minimum:", minimum)


# CLASS IN PYTHON = theory same as c++, syntax is different.

# Define the class
# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         # Initialize object attributes
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

# # Create an object of the class
# person1 = Person("Alice", 30)

# # Access object attributes
# print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice
# print(person1.age)   # Output: 30
